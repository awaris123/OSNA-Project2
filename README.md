# OSNA-Project2

## Running Colab Notebook

Run through all the cells, EXCEPT for the cells under the section headers: 

`This is the code modified from preprocessing.py to extract embeddings from BERT or even word2vec since these vectors are wasteful to recalculate on the fly. Don't run unless you want to extract and store embeddings.`

`Evaluate here... Do not unless it is for Kaggle Submission. Takes a bit of time`

These cells are not neccesary to run anymore and take a while
